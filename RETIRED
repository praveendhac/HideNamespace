To implement this feature our ValidatingWebhook need to process HTTP GET requests but as per below conversation Webhooks doesn't receive HTTP GET requests so retiring the project.

I am developing a validating admission, which need to process all the requests received by APIServer but not working as expected, below is my validatingwebhookconfiguration
```apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
 name: test-vwh
 labels:
   app: test-vwh
webhooks:
    - name: test-vwh.praveend.com
      clientConfig:
        service:
            name: test-vwh-svc
            namespace: vwh
        caBundle: ${CA_BUNDLE}
      rules:
        - operations: ["*"]
          apiGroups: [""]
          apiVersions: ["v1"]
          resources: ["*"]
      failurePolicy: Ignore```

What are you seeing that is unexpected?
that will only send resources from the core API group ("") in version "v1" to your webhook (edited) 
and if there any errors calling your webhook will ignore the error and allow the request
is that what you want?

@sttts ^^^ re: blog post for CRD/webhook stuff (edited) 

praveend [3:54 PM]
Webhook works, I can see requests while creating a resource using `operations: ["CREATE"]` but not seeing requests related to get/list commands like `kubectl get po --all-namespaces` or `kubectl get po pod -name -n ns -o wide` using `operations: ["*"]`

@praveend admission is not called on get/list. That's by design.

liggitt [4:18 PM]
admission only intercepts data being put into the API, e.g. writes

praveend [5:06 PM]
Oh! Thanks for the info @sttts @liggitt If not webhooks, is there a way to read and control `get/list` requests, may be using other mechanisms.

liggitt [5:06 PM]
authorization is the only way to control them
that just allows/forbids entirely
you cannot filter list or control based on label/field selector (edited) 

praveend [5:23 PM]
authorization? any reference please.

Thanks @liggitt, has gone through the above wiki, even Webhook Authorization mode sends HTTP POST, so no way for a webhoot to receive HTTP GET requests?
